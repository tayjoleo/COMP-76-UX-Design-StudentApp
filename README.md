# COMP-76: UX Design - SLC Login Portal

## Project Overview
This repository showcases a UX case study for the **SLC Login Portal**, developed as part of the **COMP-76 UX Design course**. The project focuses on **usability analysis, wireframe mockups, and user-centered design principles** using Figma.

## Goal
The objective of this project was to design an **intuitive and user-friendly interface** for a student-focused login portal. The design process involved:
- Conducting **user research** and developing **empathy maps**.
- Creating **low-fidelity wireframes** to prototype solutions.
- Evaluating usability and iterating designs based on feedback.

## Skills & Technologies
- **UX Research:** Empathy Mapping, User Personas, Usability Testing
- **Tools:** Figma (Wireframing, Prototyping)
- **Design Principles:** User-Centered Design, Accessibility, Information Architecture

## UX Research
A deep understanding of user needs and frustrations informed the design process:
- **Pain Points:** Complexity in access, lack of intuitive navigation, poor mobile experience.
- **User Needs:** Simplified login, clear dashboard, mobile-friendly interaction.

### **User Personas**
User personas were developed to represent **key user groups**, ensuring design decisions aligned with real-world behaviors. The personas highlighted:
- **Backgrounds:** Student demographics and tech proficiency.
- **Frustrations & Goals:** Common login challenges and feature expectations.

### **Empathy Mapping**
Empathy maps analyzed **how users think, feel, and interact** with student portals. This process:
- Identified **usability barriers**.
- Guided the creation of **more accessible navigation flows**.

## Wireframes
Wireframes for the **SLC Login Portal** included:
- **Login Screen:** Simplified authentication process.
- **Home Dashboard:** Centralized student resources.
- **Courses Page:** Quick access to enrolled classes.
- **Calendar Page:** Integrated scheduling for assignments and deadlines.
- **Grades Page:** Clear academic performance tracking.
